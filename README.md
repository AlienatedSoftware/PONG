This is part of the CS50 Game Dev course, in this project I will be creating the iconic 1972 PONG game.

- Install [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/)
- Download the zip file of my source code in my GitHub [repo](https://github.com/AlienatedSoftware/PONG)
- Drag the folder and open it up with LOVE.exe
- Enjoy! (press 'esc' to quit the game)
